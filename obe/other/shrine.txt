====== shrine ======

===== Definition: =====

A shrine is a place or shelter which is dedicated to the worship of a deity. Literally the word is "high place," referring to the location of these shrines on hills.

  * A shrine would normally have some type of altar to offer sacrifices.
  * In the Bible, the use of the term "shrine" usually refers to a place of pagan deity worship, but in some contexts it may refer to a place where Yahweh was worshiped for awhile, before the temple was built by Solomon.
  * Often worship at the "shrines" or "high places" is mentioned as a sign that the Israelites were not being faithful to God.
  * Some Israelite leaders destroyed the shrines and idols to encourage the people to return to worshiping Yahweh, but most of them did not. As a result, the Israelites turned away from Yahweh and became involved in immoral practices that were associated with idol-worship.
