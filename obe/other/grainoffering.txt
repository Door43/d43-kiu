====== grain offering ======

===== Definition: =====

A grain offering was a gift of wheat or barley flour offered to God, often after a burnt offering.

  * The grain used for the grain offering had to be finely ground up. Sometimes it was cooked before being offered, but other times it was left uncooked.
  * Oil and salt were added to the grain flour, but no yeast or honey was permitted.
  * Part of the grain offering was burned up and part of it was eaten by the priests.
