====== Herod Antipas ======

===== Facts: =====

Herod Antipas was the Roman ruler of Judea during most of Jesus' life. He was sometimes referred to as "King Herod" even though he was not really a true king.

  * Herod Antipas ruled one-fourth of the territory of his father, and so he was also called "Herod the Tetrarch" since "tetrarch" means "one-fourth."
  * Antipas was the Herod who gave the order for John the Baptist to be killed by beheading.
  * He was also the Herod who questioned Jesus before his crucifixion.
  * Other Herods in the Bible were "Herod the Great," "Herod Agrippa," and "Herod Agrippa 2."
