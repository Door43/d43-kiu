====== Job ======

===== Facts: =====

Job was a man who is described in the Bible as blameless and righteous before God. He is best known for persevering in his faith in God through times of terrible suffering.

  * Job lived in the land of Uz, which was located somewhere east of the land of Canaan, possibly near the region of the Edomites.
  * It is thought that he lived some time during the time of Esau and Jacob because one of his friends was a "Temanite" which was a people group named after Esau's grandson.
  * The Old Testament book of Job tells about how Job and others responded to his suffering. It also gives God's viewpoint as the sovereign creator and ruler of the universe.
  * After all the disasters, God eventually healed Job and gave him more children and wealth.
