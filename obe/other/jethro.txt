===== Facts: =====

The names "Jethro" and "Reuel" both refer to the father of Moses' wife, Zipporah. There were also two other men named "Reuel" in the Old Testament.

  * When Moses was a shepherd in the land of Midian, he married the daughter of a Midianite man named Reuel.
  * Later on Reuel is referred to as "Jethro, the priest of Midian."  It could be that "Reuel" was his clan name.
