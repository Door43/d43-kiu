====== Galatia ======

===== Facts: =====

In New Testament times, Galatia was a large Roman province located in the central part of what is now the country of Turkey.

  * Part of Galatia bordered the Black Sea to the north. It was also bordered by the provinces of Asia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Celicia, and Pamphylia.
  * The apostle Paul wrote a letter to the Christians who lived in the province of Galatia. This letter is the New Testament book called "Galatians."
  * One reason that Paul wrote his letter to the Galatians was to emphasize again the gospel of salvation by grace, not by works.
  * The Gentile Christians in Galatia were being taught by the Jewish Christians there that it was necessary for believers to keep certain Jewish laws.
