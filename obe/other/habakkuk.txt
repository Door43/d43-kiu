Habakkuk was an Old Testament prophet who lived around the time that King Jehoiakim was reigning over Judah. The prophet Jeremiah was also alive during some of this time.

  * Yahweh gave Habakkuk the prophecy about how the "Chaldeans" (Babylonians) would come and conquer the people of Judah.
  * One of Habakkuk's most well-known statements is: "the righteous person shall live by his faith."
