====== Samson ======

===== Facts: =====

Samson was one of the judges, or deliverers, of Israel. He was from the tribe of Dan.

  * God gave Samson superhuman strength which he used to fight against Israel's enemies, the Philistines.
  * Samson was put under a vow to never cut his hair and to never drink wine or any other fermented drink. As long as he kept this vow, God continued to give him strength.
  * He finally broke his vow and allowed his hair to be cut, which enabled the Philistines to capture him.
  * While Samson was in captivity, God enabled him to regain his strength and gave him the opportunity to destroy the temple of the false god Dagon, along with many Philistines.
