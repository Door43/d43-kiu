====== Jerusalem ======

===== Facts: =====

Jerusalem was originally an ancient Canaanite city that later became the most important city in Israel. It is still the capital city of present-day Israel.

  * The name, "Jerusalem" is first mentioned in the book of Joshua. Other names for this city include "Salem", "city of Jebus" and "Zion."
  * Both "Jerusalem" and "Salem" have the root meaning of "peace."
  * King David captured Jerusalem from the Jebusites and made it his capital city.
  * David's son Solomon built the first temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. The temple was rebuilt there after it was destroyed by the Babylonians.
  * Because the temple was in Jerusalem, the major Jewish festivals were celebrated there.
  * People normally referred to going "up" to Jerusalem since it was located in the mountains.
