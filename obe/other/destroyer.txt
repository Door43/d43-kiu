===== Definition: =====

The term "destroyer" literally means, "person who destroys."

  * When God sent the angel to kill all the firstborn males in Egypt, that angel was referred to as, "the destroyer of the firstborn." This could be translated as, "the one (or angel) who killed the firstborn males."
