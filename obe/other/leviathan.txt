====== Leviathan ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "Leviathan" refers to a very large, extinct animal mentioned in the earliest writings of the Old Testament, in the books of Job, Psalms, and Isaiah.

  * Leviathan is described as a large, snake-like creature, strong and fierce and able to make the water around him "boil." The descriptions of it are similar to that of a dinosaur.
  * Isaiah the prophet refers to Leviathan as "the gliding serpent".
  * Job writes from firsthand knowledge of Leviathan, so the animal was most likely alive during his lifetime.
