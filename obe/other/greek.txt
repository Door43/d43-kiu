====== Greek, Grecian ======

===== Facts: =====

During New Testament times, Greek was the language spoken in Greece and throughout the Roman Empire.  The term "Grecian" means 
"Greek-speaking."

  * The term "Greek" is also sometimes used in the Bible to refer in general to someone who is a "Gentile" or "non-Jew."
  * In New Testament times, most non-Jewish people in the Roman Empire spoke Greek, even though they might be of a different nationality. An example of this was the Syro-Phoenician woman in Mark 7 who was referred to as "Greek."
  * When used in this way, for someone who is not a Jew, other ways to translate "Greek" would be, "Gentile" or "non-Jew."
  * Instead of "Grecian," some English versions use the term "Hellenistic," which is a transliteration of the Greek word. [TA: transliteration] This is in contrast to the  "Hebrews" or "Hebraic Jews," who spoke only Hebrew or perhaps Aramaic.
  * Other ways to translate "Grecian" could include, "Greek-speaking" or "culturally Greek" or "Greek."
