===== Definition: =====

The terms "Yahweh of hosts" and "God of hosts" are titles that express God's authority over the thousands of angels who obey him.

  * The term "host" or "hosts" is a word that refers to a large number of something, such as an army of people or the massive number of stars.
  * Older English versions of the Bible use the term "hosts" to refer to angels, armies, and stars.
  * The phrase "host of heaven" refers to all the stars, planets and other heavenly bodies.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Ways to translate the title "Yahweh of hosts" or "God of hosts" could include, "Yahweh, who rules all the angels" or "God, the ruler over armies of angels."
  * The term "host" could also be translated as "army" or "large number."
  * Certain churches do not accept the literal term "Yahweh" and prefer to use "LORD" instead, following the tradition of many Bible versions that use "LORD." All capital letters are used as a sign of reverence to God. For these churches, the term "LORD of hosts" would be used.
