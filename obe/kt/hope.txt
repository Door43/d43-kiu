====== hope ======

===== Definition: =====

In modern English, the term "hope" usually means to desire that something will happen, without being certain that it will happen. 

  * In many English translations of the Bible, the term "hope" is often used to refer to a sure expectation of receiving what God has promised his people. However, this is usually translated as "confidence" in the ULB, since that term better represents the meaning of being sure or certain about something.
  * To have "no hope" means to have no expectation of something good happening.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * In most contexts in the ULB, the term "to hope" could also be translated as "to wish" or "to desire" or "to expect."
  * The phrase, "nothing to hope for" could be translated as "nothing to trust in" or "no expectation of anything good"
  * To "have no hope" could be translated as, "have no expectation of anything good" or "have no security" or "be sure that nothing good will happen."
  * The idiom, "have set your hopes on" could also be translated as "have put your confidence in" or "have been trusting in."
