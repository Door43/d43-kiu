====== Son of Man, son of man ======

===== Definition: =====

The title, "Son of Man" was used by Jesus to refer to himself. He often used this term instead of saying "I" or "me."

  * In the Bible, "son of man" can be a way of referring to or addressing a man. It can also mean "human being."
  * Throughout the Old Testament book of Ezekiel, God frequently addresses Ezekiel as "son of man." For example he says, "You, son of man, must prophesy."
  * The prophet Daniel saw a vision of a "son of man" coming with the clouds, which is a reference to the coming Messiah.
  * Jesus also said that the Son of Man will be coming back someday on the clouds.
  * These references to the Son of Man coming on the clouds reveal that Jesus the Messiah is God.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * When Jesus uses the term "Son of Man," this could be translated as, "the One who became a human being" or "the Man from heaven."
  * Some translators occasionally include "I" or "me" with this title (as in, "I, the Son of Man") to make it clear that Jesus is talking about himself.
  * Check to make sure that the translation of this term does not give a wrong meaning (such as referring to an illegitimate son or giving the wrong impression that Jesus was only a human being).
  * When used to refer to a person, "son of man" could also be translated as, "you, a human being" or "you, man" or "human being" or "man."
