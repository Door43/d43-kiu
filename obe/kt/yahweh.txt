====== Yahweh ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "Yahweh" is God's personal name that he revealed to Moses at the burning bush.

  * The name "Yahweh" comes from the word that means, "to be" or "to exist."
  * Possible meanings of "Yahweh" include, "he is" or "I am" or "the one who causes to be."
  * This name reveals that God has always lived and will continue to live forever. It also means that he is always present.
  * Many Bible versions in major languages (such as English, French, and Spanish) use the term "the LORD" to represent "Yahweh." For example, the literal text "I am Yahweh your God" is often translated as, "I am the LORD your God." The word is written with all capital letters to show respect for God's personal name.
  * Some church denominations strongly prefer using "LORD" instead of "Yahweh."
  * However, the ULB and UDB always translate God's personal name as "Yahweh," as it literally occurs in the Old Testament Hebrew text.
  * In the New Testament, the personal name "Yahweh" does not occur. The word for "Lord" is used instead.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * "Yahweh" could be translated by a word or phrase that means "I am" or "living one" or "the one who is" or "he who is alive."
  * This term could also be written in a way that is similar to how "Yahweh" is spelled.
  * Note that it is best //not// to translate this term with "Jehovah," which is a word that was created by combining the vowels of the Hebrew word, "Lord" with the consonants of "Yahweh."
